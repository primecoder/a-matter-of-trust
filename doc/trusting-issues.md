# Issues with Trust

I have an issue with trust - in fact, many. 

First of, earning trust. Trust is not made, it is earned. Earning trust has little to do with computing. It is about getting to know a person, finding out details about the person, and deciding to trust him or her.

So, you have trusted the person. Until the next time, you meet. How do you identify a person again? Let’s just call this person John. It will be easy for you if you meet him again, as you would have recognise him. But, what if you send down you kid to meet him. Tell uncle John our secret soccer practice is this Thursday night. If you kid never met John before, how he would trust him.

Welcome to the first problem of authentication.

If your kid was an app that your wrote, and John was one of your customers, how would you let John access his private information within your app? You need a secret that only known between you and John.

## Password Authentication

The first naturally solution that would come to your mind would be to prearrange with John some secret code. John would suggest that he will be the one wearing funny green hat with owl feather on top, or that could be his password - “funny green hat with owl feather”.

Problem solved. You kid would go down the road and only tell John about your secret soccer practice only if the person asking would tell him that “funny green hat with owl feather” is the passcode.

What could go wrong? In the world of brutal soccer games where knowing bits of extra information could mean win or lose the season. 

- Someone could pretend to be John and guessing out all the combination of the passcodes until he/she gets it right

- Some bully might intercept your kid and force him to tell the passcode and the bully then go to meet John telling him false information
